# Bridge-decay-prediction

This Jupyter Notebook containing a dataset set from kaggle with information on bridges in New york, presents a machine learning approach to predict the decay condition of bridges over time. By leveraging data science and engineering principles, the notebook walks through a comprehensive process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization to support predictive maintenance strategies in infrastructure management. Also a map showing the different bridge types across new york.
