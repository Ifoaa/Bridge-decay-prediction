# Bridge Decay Prediction

This repository contains a predictive data analytics project that analyzes bridge condition data and uses machine learning to model deterioration patterns in infrastructure assets.

The project demonstrates an applied workflow for spatial and predictive analytics that can support **maintenance prioritization, infrastructure planning, and data-driven decision support**.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Bridges are critical components of transportation infrastructure, and monitoring their condition over time is essential for safety, maintenance budgeting, and long-term planning. Using a public bridge dataset, this project performs:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Predictive modeling of deterioration
- Mapping and visualization of bridge types

This notebook demonstrates how to incorporate spatial and tabular data into a machine learning pipeline to generate actionable insights.
